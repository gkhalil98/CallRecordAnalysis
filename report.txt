Github repo:

Steps:
1.) I copied over the callData.json file to my project folder and created the app.js file to hold the logic.
2.) I installed fs and mongoose using npm install so that I could read the file and I could use schema and model functions of mongoose.
3.) I followed the logic of the trainers for the most part of the code and then I used the .insertMany function to quickly insert all the data according to my predefined model.
4.) I uploaded the project to Github.
